Personalized PageRank Community Detection (PPRCD).

Read graph files in METIS format. And detects communities. Writes one
community per line to stdout. Each number represents a vertex.

Usage:
  pprcd FILE [-a ALPHA] [-t TOLERANCE] [-s SEEDS] [--stats]
  pprcd (-h | --help)
  pprcd --version

Options:
  -a ALPHA      Alpha value [default: 0.99].
  -t TOLERANCE  Tolerance value [default: 0.01].
  -s SEEDS      Vertices to use as seeds. If no seeds are specified the
                    algorithm will attempt to detect all communities. Vertices
                    must be separated with only one comma.
  --stats       Write statistics to CSV files. Files will be named FILE-STAT
                    .csv, located in same directory as FILE. Availible
                    statistics (STAT) are described below:
                block-matrix: adjacenty matrix, describing degree of edges
                    between blocks. Loops (identities) are internal degree.
                block-size: number of vertices in each block.
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.
